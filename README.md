# Image_Classification.

######  1. Using CNN Algorithm, I have designed Traffic Sign Recognition using Image Classification
######  2.  I have used Total traffic sign images more than 50,000 and classes = 43 for training and testing.
######  3.  Feature Include: 93% Accurate.
######  4.  Python libraries used: Numpy, pandas, Matplotlib, seaborn, os, cv2
######  5.  Traffic Sign Recognition Using Image Classification and The accuracy achieved on the test dataset is 93%. 
######  6.  Traffic signs displayed on the roads play an important role in our lives while driving.Traffic Sign Classification is employed to detect and classify traffic signs to inform and warn a driver beforehand to avoid violation of rules. There are certain disadvantages of the existing systems, used for classification, like incorrect predictions, hardware cost and maintenance, which are to a great extent resolved by the proposed system.
######  7.   The proposed approach implements a traffic signs classification algorithm employing a convolutional neural network. Also, it consists of the feature of web cam detection of the traffic sign. This will help the driver to observe the sign close to his / her eyes on the display screen and thus save his/her time in manually checking the traffic sign each time.

##### A convolutional neural network is a class of deep learning networks, used to examine and check visual imagery. It is used to train the image classification and recognition model because of its high accuracy and precision.
