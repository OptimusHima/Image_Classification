# Image_Classification
Traffic Sign Recognition Using Image Classification and The accuracy achieved on the test dataset is 93%. 
Traffic signs displayed on the roads play an important role in our lives while driving.Traffic Sign Classification is employed to detect and classify traffic signs to inform and warn a driver beforehand to avoid violation of rules. There are certain disadvantages of the existing systems, used for classification, like incorrect predictions, hardware cost and maintenance, which are to a great extent resolved by the proposed system. The proposed approach implements a traffic signs classification algorithm employing a convolutional neural network. Also, it consists of the feature of web cam detection of the traffic sign. This will help the driver to observe the sign close to his / her eyes on the display screen and thus save his/her time in manually checking the traffic sign each time.
A convolutional neural network is a class of deep learning networks, used to examine and check visual imagery. It is used to train the image classification and recognition model because of its high accuracy and precision.
Traffic sign classification is the process of automatically recognizing traffic signs (like speed limit, yield, and caution signs, etc.) and accordingly classifies them as to which class they belong to. The project has two main functionalities: Prediction on the newly generated dataset (fig. 6) and live web cam traffic sign detection.
